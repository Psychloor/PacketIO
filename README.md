# PacketIO

A modern C++23 header-only library for efficient packet handling and binary serialization. PacketIO provides robust utilities for reading and writing binary data with built-in endianness support.

## Features

- Header-only library â€” include and use
- Modern C++23 implementation
- Endian-aware reading and writing (LE/BE)
- Zero-copy optimizations where possible
- Strong type safety with compile-time checks
- Efficient binary buffer management
- Support for framed packet processing
- String handling utilities (fixed, variable, null-terminated)

## Requirements

- C++23 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.31 or higher

## Installation

### Using CMake FetchContent
```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
        PacketIO
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Psychloor/PacketIO.git
        GIT_TAG main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(PacketIO)

target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE PacketIO::PacketIO)
```
### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Psychloor/PacketIO.git
```
2. Add to your CMake project:
```cmake
add_subdirectory(PacketIO)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE PacketIO::PacketIO)
```
## Quick Start
```cpp
#include <packet_buffers.hpp>
#include <framed_packet_reader.hpp>

// Writing packets
net::packet_writer writer;
writer.write_le<uint32_t>(42);           // Write little-endian integer
writer.write_be<uint16_t>(1234);         // Write big-endian integer

// Reading packets
net::packet_reader reader(writer.span());
auto value1 = reader.read_le<uint32_t>(); // Read little-endian integer
auto value2 = reader.read_be<uint16_t>(); // Read big-endian integer

// Framed packet handling
net::framed_packet_reader<MyPacket, MyError> packet_reader(
    [](net::packet_reader& reader) {
        // Your packet parsing logic here
        return parse_result;
    }
);
```
## Core Components
